# Lune
Yet another project with a 'engine' running using vulkan and imgui. Nothing much, just funzzies with own ECS implementation and vulkan stuf.

Mostly it's attempt to make something better based on what I learned when writing [dreco-engine](https://github.com/GloryOfNight/dreco-engine-vulkan)

Maybe there still some good code to salvage for someone out there xd or not
